# Week 1-4: Calculate Triangle Area Exercise

This repository contains Python code that computes the area of a triangle given its base and height.
The program is simple to understand and is a helpful resource/example for anyone looking to learn how to perform basic arithmetic operations in Python.

Overview:
The code is a Python program that calculates the area of a triangle given its base and height. It expects an input of the base and height of a triangle, and outputs the area of the triangle rounded to two decimal places.

Breakdown:
To solve the problem, the I first had to understand the prompt, which required me to calculate the area of a triangle using the formula (base * height) / 2. Then, I broke down the problem into smaller sub-problems by storing the base and height in variables, calculating the area of the triangle using arithmetic operators, and  printing the area of the triangle to the console.

The code uses the input() function to prompt the user to enter the base and height of the triangle, and then stores those values in the 'base' and 'height' variables. It then calculates the area of the triangle using the formula (base * height) / 2, and stores that value in the 'area' variable. To control the precision of the output, I learned that I could use the built-in round() function to round the area of the triangle to two decimal places. Finally, the program uses the print() function to output the result to the user.

Takeaways:
This code demonstrates the importance of breaking down problems into smaller sub-problems and understanding the tools available to solve the problem. Additionally, the code highlights the importance of controlling the precision of the output when working with mathematical operations that require a specific level of accuracy.

One area for improvement in this code would be to add error handling for unexpected user input, such as entering a string instead of a number.
